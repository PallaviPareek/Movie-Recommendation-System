# Movie-Recommender-System
A recommendation system focuses on information filtering  to predict a user's preferences and providing suggestions based on these interests. These systems collect information about a user's preferences and behaviour and then utilise that data to improve future suggestions. Movie Recommendation Systems assist us in looking for our favourite movies among all of these different sorts of movies, therefore saving us the difficulty of spending a lot of time searching for our preferred movies.
